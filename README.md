## Introduction
### Osaka - Local restaurant research before travel.

Osaka shares some similarities with Tokyo, the Capital of Japan. 

Inspire by https://medium.com/@radialee/capstone-project-the-battle-of-neighborhoods-in-tokyo-restaurants-45a503e65ff, the mentioned project studied Tokyo's restaurant data since it will be the city holding 2020 Olyampic Games and discuss how to support increasing visitors on one of their needs - Food. As Japan's third largest city (credit to: http://www.webster.edu/study-abroad/programs/japan/osaka/facts.html), I am curious about Osaka's potential. I had visited Osaka once before in person, this time I will take a different approach to view this city, start from its local restaurant.

### Further dicussion on the problem

In 2019, Japan's Tourism Hits Record Numbers (credit to: https://www.tourism.jp/en/tourism-database/stats/inbound/), the amount of foreign visitors and their spending during travel also record a huge boost (credit to : https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/japans-tourism-hits-record-numbers-in-2019-300979556.html). Although Osaka was consider a well-developed city, visitors may encounter difficult to find desired restaurant. In this study, I hoped to apply data from Foursquare's location data, apply clustering methods (mainly K-means), breakdown Osaka as clusters and identify which cluster visitors should go for certain type of restaurants.
