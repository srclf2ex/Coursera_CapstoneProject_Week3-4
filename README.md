## Introduction
### Osaka - Local Shop research before travel.

Osaka shares some similarities with Tokyo, the Capital of Japan. 
Inspire by https://medium.com/@radialee/capstone-project-the-battle-of-neighborhoods-in-tokyo-restaurants-45a503e65ff, the mentioned project studied Tokyo's restaurant data since it will be the city holding 2020 Olyampic Games and discuss how to support increasing visitors on one of their needs - Food. As Japan's third largest city (credit to: http://www.webster.edu/study-abroad/programs/japan/osaka/facts.html), I am curious about Osaka's potential. I had visited Osaka once before in person, this time I will take a different approach to view this city, start from its local shops.
